# Video Compression Using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

## Introduction
This project implements video compression using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The goal is to reduce the file size of video frames while preserving visual quality through matrix approximation techniques.

## Motivation
With the increasing volume of digital video content, efficient storage and transmission have become crucial. Traditional compression methods can be complex and computationally expensive. SVD provides a mathematical framework for approximating matrices, which is particularly useful in image and video compression.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python packages:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV

You can install the required packages via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python
